Delegation
==========

* What to delegate
* How
* Benefits

.. note::

    Now we know Why - lets look at the what
    
    Main part of this Masterclass is three areas

----

:data-x: r0
:data-y: r800


What to Delegate
================

* Interesting  
* Development
* Where the context is known

.. note::

    Golden rules

    Got to be of interest to the person your delegating to

    Should develop the person 

    Must be where the context is known 

----

:id: danger

Danger
==========

* No context  
* Answer you can not live with
* Not interesting or boring

.. note::

    If people donâ€™t have the right context, they may make the 'wrong' answer. Context: Reduce costs, but this may end-up minimise 'Engineering' or 'Procurement' costs as the detrement to the wider project costs.

    You delegate Authority, but keep responsibility

    So you have to live with the decision.

    You be accused of being lazy if it is boring, (person not motivated)

Context
==========

* Does the person know ?  
* How, preparation ?
* Strategy, intent - not how

.. note::

    Communication, Communication, Communication.

    What are we trying to achieve ? [Our design easier to build]  Great leaders bang on about what they are trying to achieve.

    Need to have done the preparation before hand. [Explain or demo how building is hard]

    IMPORTANT You not communicating how to do it or even what to do but your intent. IMPORTANT

    e.g. Reduce cost of installation of on site, out design easier to build
    
    I may think that symmetrical, reduce part count. But again, need to keep space for whole of team to think - for the best diverse range of solutions.

Live with it
============

* Think of all the outcomes
* Trust the delegated person  
* Roll with it

.. note::

    If you have the _Intent_ correct; then this should not be a problem. 
    
    The how may be different or novel, but who care - intent is correct

Avoid Boring
============

* Not the rubbish
* Might have to sell it
* Communication is key

.. note::

    Last What: 
    Reason for delegating something should not be it is boring.

Mistaken Dangers
================

* Too difficult
* Not authorised
* Not competent

.. note::

    Couple of thing that DO NOT Stop you, 

    Too difficult; Good -> Interesting, Development

    You resposible, so it up to you if you want to deligate. You are passing your Authority (but not responsibility) to them

    You never going to grow people if you assume not competent

Do, Check, Go
